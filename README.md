# Bone-Segmentation
#  RA Selection Task â€“ Knee CT Bone Segmentation and Landmark Detection

This repository contains my submission for the Research Assistant selection task, which focuses on processing 3D CT scans of the knee to perform bone segmentation, mask manipulation, and anatomical landmark detection.

 #Project Summary

The task involves:
- Segmenting the **femur and tibia** from a knee CT scan using image processing techniques.
- Expanding the segmented masks **uniformly by 2 mm** and optionally 4 mm.
- Generating **randomized masks** that lie between the original and expanded contours.
- Detecting the **lowest medial and lateral points** on the tibial surface for each mask.
